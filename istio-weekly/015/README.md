## Show notes

Join us on December 9th for the next Istio weekly episode, where we'll show you how to install Istio with an external control plane.

The external control plane deployment model offers a clean separation between mesh operators and mesh administrators.  Mesh operators install and manage Istioâ€™s control plane on one cluster and then connect one or more remote clusters (data planes) to form a mesh. Mesh administrators can then configure the mesh as needed.

At [23:22](https://youtu.be/MaQ3PvXcT9c?t=1401) when creating the TLS secret. The .zip from SSLForFree contains 3 files:

1. ca_bundle.crt
2. certificate.crt
3. private.key

Instead of creating a secret and passing in certificate.crt for the --cert argument, you need to merge the ca_bundle with the certificate. So, create a new file called `combined.crt` paste in the contents of the `certificate.crt` file and then below that paste the contents of the `ca_bundle.crt` file. 

Then you can create the TLS secret and reference the `combined.crt` file instead: "kubectl create secret tls cp-istioweekly --key=private.key --cert=combined.crt".
