## Show notes

How can you customize Istio installation? What is Istio operator and how can you configure it? Can I run multiple Istio ingress gateways? The answer is yes!  

Join us in this episode where introduce the Istio operator and talk about how to deploy multiple Istio ingress gateways. Running more than one Istio ingress gateway allows for more complex scenarios. For example, you can run a separate internal ingress gateway for internal traffic, a dedicated public gateway, or running any combination of internal and/or external ingress gateways.
