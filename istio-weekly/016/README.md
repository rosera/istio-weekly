## Show notes

Join us on January 20th for the first Istio weekly episode in 2022. Eitan Suez will explore how Istio configures Envoy proxies.

Have you ever wondered what happens when you deploy a VirtualService or a DestinationRule? We know Istio translates the high-level configuration to the low-level Envoy configuration, but do we really understand how the different concepts map to each other? Eitan will show us how to use Istio CLI, proxy-status, and proxy-config commands to inspect the parts of Envoy configuration. Join us!
